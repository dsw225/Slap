## General questions

1. Did the PM for this week submit this report (If not, why not?)? 

Yes. 

2. Has the team been gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?

Yes, the team has been meeting weekly in person every Tuesday afternoon, and over zoom as needed. In addition to that, the team is constantly making use of Whatsapp and Slack to ask questions and update each other of their progress. 

3. Summarize how well the team met the requirements of this sprint.

Starting this print, the team was feeling overwhelmed with midterm exams and we struggled a lot with the last tutorial. With that in mind, all team members started working on the design phase later on the weekend, we met together for the first time on Sunday afternoon, and finished our team delieverables video past 11pm, shortly before the deadline.

We managed to meet most of the sprint requirements. We did miss out on presenting Demos, as coding was not part of sprint. However, we did provide explanations in the video. All other requirements were duly met.

All team members frequently checked on each other, offering assistance and updating the group on their progress. Our collaborative Zoom sessions were especially productive, leading to a collective understanding and creation of the necessary diagrams, as required in the rubric. 

Now, speaking on individual efforts: Titus Whang took charge of his role as the backend, and made a lot of effort in understanding git, he did an amazing job on the backend diagrams, was instrumental in resolving a merge conflict. Dan Warnick dedicated himself to mastering React and Figma, eventually creating a UI interface for the web page. Junan as the mobile developer, with Dan's help, created a UI interface for the mobile app. Brandon Arriaga efficiently completed the ER diagram, fulfilling his role's requirements. Barbara as the PM, started the Trello board early and went over the Phase 1 Assignment overview making sure everything was covered.



4. Report on each member's progress (sprint and phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"
    * If incomplete, what challenges are being overcome, how are they being overcome, and by when will the team member be able to finish?
    * If complete, how do you know everyone completed the work, and at a satisfactory level?

All requirements have been met. We did not show any Demo, however, code was not part of this sprint. We met together over zoom, and we went over the Rubric as we recorded our Team Deliverables video, with that, we were able to confirm that everyone has completed their part and nothing was missing. To further explain each individual team member progress and tasks, please refer to the answer of question 3. 


5. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"
    * More details will follow on code reviews.
    * For now, report out on **when** (once? multiple times?) and **how** (in person? zoom? Watching a recording?) each member showed *and discussed* their progress.
        * Was this done individually with the PM, or together as a team?
        * Did you watch each other’s videos? Did you each look at each others’ trello boards and git commit history?
        * Did you notify each other via slack as you completed each tutorial?
        * Were these reviews scheduled, or "on-demand" / as completed?

The Trello board is fully relevant and updated to the sprint, all required tasks for each team member were listed in the cards. However, we all discussed the work together and participated in the creation of the diagrams. Then, once we finished our individual efforts, we met over Zoom again, and went over the rubric together and checking our work, and nothing was missing from the requirements. Therefore, we met two times over Zoom for a total of 4-5h: One to discuss the sprint work and requirements, and then to record the video and check that everything was met.  


6. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?

I started the Trello Board early, and made sure to fully incorporated all requirements and tasks listed on the Phase 1 description file. In addition to that, I constantly asked the team about their progress and if they needed any help. I also tried to be as responsive as I could on our group chat to stay updated on the Team's progress. 

7. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?

I always tried to answers questions and concerns. However, since the very beggining, this is something very natural within our team, everyone is caring and is constantly offering help, and being honest about their progress. 

8. How well is the team communicating?
    * What is the nature of the conversations? Is it all business, or are you getting to know each other better in small and various ways?
    * Has one or more team members been communicating infrequently, only after a long delay, or in a non-transparent way? 
        * If so, what did you and/or the team do about this? How was this handled?
        * What was the reaction? 
        * Has communication improved?

We do most of our communication in person, but as we transition from the tutorials to working on our project, we have been messaging each other almost every day with questions, comments, advice and/or concerns. We also agred to start meeting twice a week instead of one, in addition to that, we have been talking about doing Daily Stand Ups to keep track of each other's work, especially now that we depend on each other's work to complete the requirements. 

The nature of our conversations vary a lot, we talk about other classes, or just life in general, it's been helping us to get to know each other better. 

9. Discuss expectations the team has set for one another, if any. Please highlight any changes from last week.
    * Some examples you may have reached consensus on are: 
        * acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, 
        * frequency of asynchronous communication (e.g. slack), 
        * regularity of "live" check-ins (in person, or on e.g. zoom), 
        * turn-taking or "stage sharing" during live meetings, 
        * safe ways to express discomfort or disagreement should emotions or tensions flare.

We haven't had the need to have a serious conversation about expectations for one another, the teammates are always respectful towards one another, and offer help and assistant to those who have roles that they are not that familiar with. 
Eeveryone has been flexible and respectful. 

10. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please make sure this is [1] itemized, [2] briefly described, [3] its status reported (resolved or unresolved), and [4] includes critical steps taken to find resolution.
    * Challenge: Merge Conflits
        * Status: Resolved
        * Description: We had a few merge conflits when trying to commit everyone individual changes to the pre master file.
        * Critical steps taken to find resolution: We agreed on not changing anything outside our individual folders and branches to avoid merge conflict. To solve the merge conflict, we have to revert a few commits and make sure that no one was changing the same file at the same time. 


## Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

0. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?

Tuesday (10/02) in person at 4:30pm for 2 hours, and on Sunday (10/08) over Zoom for about 1 hour. 

1. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?

I believe that the Trello Board had just the right amount of information, I made sure to add due dates and labels on each card, and I assigned it to a team member. Futhermore, I added a description to each card, and I added a checklist of each subtask within a card to help members to keep track of their work. 

2. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?

Our meetings take place every Tuesday afternoon, and it is when we do most of our interaction. However, we have been texting more using Slack, and Whatsapp on our progress and we agreed on meeting Thursdays afternoons as well. 

3. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Trello use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.

Our technique have not changed, but we would like to start doing Daily check-ins this week. 

4. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping thins so constructive?

No difficulties faced at the moment. I believe that we keep things constructive is the fact that everyone respects everyone's ideas and we are very good listeners. 

5. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?

My biggest concern is the time, we have been delivering everything on time and everyone has been completing all their requirements. However, as the requirements get more specific and one teammate's task depends on another teammate's work, it is crucial that we start and finish things in time. If we keep finishing our work at the very last minute, at some point, we might not have time to finish it at all.

However, we believe that by meeting twice a week, and doing daily stand ups, we will be able to start our work sooner. 

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.

The merge conflict when commiting and merging our individual tasks together. It is resolved and we believe that as long as we do not edit the same file at the same time, and work on our own branches and folders, we should not have any issues. 

7. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?
    * Consider this an opportunity to run a mini [sprint retrospective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))
      > A sprint retrospective is a separate meeting that allows team members to internally analyze strengths and weaknesses of the sprint, future areas of improvement, and continuous process improvement actions
    * An example of something you might "start" doing is including a retrospective at the end of each sprint, or checking in more frequently on slack, or respectfully checking in on expectations of eachother. 
    * An example of something you might "stop" is waiting three or more days to begin the sprint work.
    * An example of something you might "continue" is demonstrating open, honest, transparent communication.

    Start: Doing the daily standup meetings. 
    Stop: Starting to work on our project shortly before the deadline. 
    Continue: To care for each other and give assistance when possible.  

8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the sprint? How did your time estimates change as the sprint progressed?

I estimamted that the team video, and merging our branches would be much quicker than it was. Since we faced meerge conflicts and it was tough to find a time that everyone was available, it ended up taking a lot unexected extra time. 

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?

I believe that this is very early on to address and think about any concerns for our customer, we did not start coding yet, and don't have a demo yet. Once we have a demo, and we start seeing and improving functionality, we will be able to see if there any things that might need improvement.
